# Automatic Hardhat Wearing Detection

Detecting hardhat-use and identifying the corresponding colors of a hardhat on construction sites based on SSD framework.

## Introduction

This work tries to automate the monitoring of whether people are wearing hardhat on the construction sites and identify the corresponding colors.  Currently,  on the proposed dataset of GDUT-Hardhat Wearing Detection (GDUT-HWD), the SSD model combined with our reverse progressive attention (SSD-RPA) achieves  83.89% mAP with the input size 512Ã—512. In addition, we have released models that are suitable for mobile devices.

## Preparation

1. Install dependencies the Caffe framework needs. You can visit the [caffe official website](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html) and follow the instructions there to install the dependent libraries and drivers correctly.

2. Clone the SSD-RPA repository and compile the code.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/wujixiu/helmet-detection.git
   
   cd cd helmet-detection/hardhat-wearing-detection/SSD-RPA/
   
   make all -j8
   ```

3. following the instructions in SSD (https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd) to prepare data.

## Train a model (on Linux)

Suppose the code is running under the SSD-RPA directory and data is prepared.

1. Download [VGG_ILSVRC_16_layers_fc_reduced](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1qkj5TaR33FuaUtaIOuhMWA) or [peleenet](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1AXSvPpwClTMGKwKRFT9Tlg) and put them in models directory.
2. Run the training scripts.

```shell
sh examples/Hardhat/SSD300/train_SSD300.sh
```

## Deploy a pre-trained model 

All models are based on Caffe.

- Environments
  - Windows 10
  - Visual Studio 2013 (Release x64)
  - CPU
  - OpenCV

- C++

  It is highly recommended to use [mini-caffe](https://github.com/luoyetx/mini-caffe) to deploy model for its portability, or OpenCV3 with SSD's layer is enough if you do not use our proposed models with RPA module.  Code with OpenCV3 deployment is available in [old version](https://github.com/wujixiu/helmet-detection/old-version). For mini-caffe deployment under Windows, we provide the complied files in mini-caffe-Release, or you can compile the mini-caffe yourself.  

Notable that different models have different input size and different input scale. Details are shown below.

## Released data and models

- Dataset Statistics
  - The number of images of GDUT-HWD is 3,174, which has been split into 1,587 for training (GDUT-HWD trainval) and 1,587 for testing (GDUT-HWD test). It contains 18,893 instances falling into 5 classes and each instance is annotated with a class label andits bounding box.
